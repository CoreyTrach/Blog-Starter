Been coding for a few months now and am finding that it is harder than I initially perceived. You would think having over 10 years of experience in IT and idolizing programmers for the majority of your life would give you an advantage.

Apparently not as programming proves to be a constant challenge.

This is my first blog post using all the preferred technology during my studies. HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Javascript, markdown, React, Next.js, talwind.css
